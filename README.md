Odonata_traits
==============

The scripts in this repository will be used to produce an overview of the Odonata trait data 
measurements held within the Biological Records Centre (BRC). Additionally, we have uploaded 
a script that combines the trait measurement data to the single value per trait data set.

The code in this repository is currently **under development**.
